# NWNTools

Project developed by Emma Johnson under the supervision of Claudia Gomes da Rocha for a NSERC USRA funded summer research project in 2021 and a PHYS 598 honours thesis at the University of Calgary in 2022/2023. 

Provides a framework for computational analysis of nanowire networks (NWNs) using geometric and electrical models. Type `NWN_circuit` is provided to encapsulate the electrical information of a NWN and analysis tools are based off of this type.
